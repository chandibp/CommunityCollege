in developmental courses or courses taken while in high school will
not count in the six grades of W. After six grades of W are received,
students must receive grades of A, B, C, D, or F in all courses.
There are other exemptions from the six-drop limit and students
should consult with a Counselor/Educational Planner before they drop
courses to determine these exemptions. <strong>Students receiving

</p>
<h1 class="western"><font color="#0000ff"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">CAMPUS
CARRY LAW:</font></font></h1>
<p>At San Jacinto College, safety is a priority for our students, our
faculty and staff, and our visitors. On Tuesday, August 1, 2017, the
Senate Bill 11 from the 84th Texas legislature, also known as the
Campus Carry law, went into effect for Texas community colleges,
including San Jacinto College. This allows license to carry holders
to generally carry concealed handguns at San Jacinto College and
other public community colleges in Texas. The law and the San Jacinto
College policy can be found online at <a href="http://www.sanjac.edu/campus-carry">Campus
Carry</a> (www.sanjac.edu/campus-carry). <br/>
<br/>
Here are a few
key points about the law: <br/>
1. The open carry of handguns on
campus is prohibited. <br/>
2. License to carry holders must carry
their handguns on or about their person or secure their handguns in a
locked motor vehicle at all times while on campus. There may be times
that students and faculty may not be able to keep a backpack or
handbag near their person at all times during a class. One example is
during test times when you may be required to be separated from your
backpack or handbag. Remember to make the necessary arrangements to
legally store your handgun in a locked motor vehicle in advance. San
Jacinto College does not provide any storage for handguns. It is a
violation of the law if your handgun is not on or about your person.
<br/>
3. There are areas designated as exclusion zones on each San
Jacinto College campus. The concealed carry of a handgun is
prohibited in these designated exclusion zones. These areas are
clearly marked by signage notifying license to carry holders that
entry with a concealed handgun is prohibited. <br/>
<br/>
Questions
about the law and the San Jacinto College policy can be directed to
the San Jacinto College Police Department at 281-476-9128 or via
email at <a href="http://www.sanjac.edu/campus-carry">Campus Carry</a>
